# Song-Vote-on-Algorand---Create-and-deploy-a-fully-functioning-Dapp
This tutorial is made for programmers of all skill levels looking to get into web3 or development on the Algorand chain. All you’ll need is some basic knowledge of javascript, python, and smart contracts. You’ll pick the rest up. By the end, you will have an understanding of what the entire development pipeline looks like on Algorand and your own functioning dapp!  I don’t like getting caught up in formality. I’ll keep the tone of this tutorial relatively casual and focus more on creating a working product than getting bogged down in technicality.  Below are all the resources and repositories for this project. I created the project in Notion and then transferred it to the Algorand developer portal.
